<h2>My Thoughts on Qualitative and Quantitative Research</h2>

As a communications student, I was required to take two courses that I know my classmates would agree were the bane of second year. Qualitative research methods in communications, and quantitative research methods in communications. In these two separate classes, we were taught about the different tools and methodologies that guide communications scholars in their research. But of all the things we were taught, all of the resources that were introduced to us, and all of the terminology we learned, I can confidently say I feel I only actually retained a fraction of the information. Sure, I remember the name of the program we used religiously in the quantitative methods class, SPSS; but I cannot for the life of me remember how to use it, navigate it, or even how it looked. I remember associating qualitative data with surveys, focus groups, and observations, but mainly because that was the textbook-definition of qualitative research. 

Looking back now, I’m inclined to question why qualitative and quantitative research had to be divided into two separate courses, with dynamically different syllabuses. I look back at my papers, in which I was asked to define a study as either qualitative or quantitative, and wonder why I could always find *one* clear answer. Why did these studies not engage both models? Wouldn’t a combination of these models provide different results, reveal new patterns, and ultimately expand the possibilities for the multiple avenues of understanding?

The Mapping Texts project was interesting to me, because I feel like it addressed some of the concerns a lot of researchers must go through when it comes to mapping out a good research model. It was very thorough, in that it revealed all the different things that go into the construction of a research project of that magnitude. It reiterated to me, also, how much is possible when a large group of individuals work together, reinforcing my belief that open-source projects in the realm of digital humanities can wield refined results that aggregate all there is to learn from historic documents.
