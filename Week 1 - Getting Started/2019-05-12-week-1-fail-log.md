# Week 1 fail log
I'm excited to start this course. Prior to my decision to register, I explored the course manual online, and the concept of 'productive failure' was really intriguing to me. I think it can be applied in a lot of different contexts, and I have sometimes had a tendency to undervalue my failures instead of actively learning from them. This class is really promising for me in that it may allow me to learn from those mistakes and track my growth. 

# First Annotation
For my [first annotation](https://hyp.is/43tObHTbEem-0Msou6n8Vg/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) I attempted to annotate 'THIS TEXT' in the Getting Started section of the workbook as directed. I ended up highlighting it multiple times, and was struggling initially to delete my duplicate highlights. Looking for my annotation later on so that I could hyperlink it to this log post, I realized that I had highlighted and annotated the text publicly, so I re-did the annotation, making sure to post it on the hist3814o stream. 

I learned to make sure I am annotating in the group in the future.
