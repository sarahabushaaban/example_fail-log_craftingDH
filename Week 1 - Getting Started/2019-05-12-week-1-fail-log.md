# Week 1 fail log
I'm excited to start this course. Prior to my decision to register, I explored the course manual online, and the concept of 'productive failure' was really intriguing to me. I think it can be applied in a lot of different contexts, and I have sometimes had a tendency to undervalue my failures instead of actively learning from them. This class is really promising for me in that it may allow me to learn from those mistakes and track my growth. 

# First Annotation
For my [first annotation](https://hyp.is/43tObHTbEem-0Msou6n8Vg/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) I attempted to annotate 'THIS TEXT' in the Getting Started section of the workbook as directed. I ended up highlighting it multiple times, and was struggling initially to delete my duplicate highlights. Looking for my annotation later on so that I could hyperlink it to this log post, I realized that I had highlighted and annotated the text publicly, so I re-did the annotation, making sure to post it on the hist3814o stream. 

I learned to make sure I am annotating in the group in the future. 

# Comments/Concerns
I think the Hypothesis plugin is something I've been missing for a long time; I can definitely see myself using this in my studies and even outside of the realm of academia. Kind of fascinating to think of annotations as documented thoughts, comments, reactions. Even more so, I'm sure it will prove useful to have these annotations archived, instead of letting any substantial insight go to waste. 

I've never worked with a program like Github, but I'm starting to get acquainted with it. It looked threatening at first, but I'm becoming more aware of the evolution of the study of history, and how tech and data are being used to enrich the discipline.
