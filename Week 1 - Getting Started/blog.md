<h1>First Week Blog</h1>
<p> To me, "digital history" looked almost like an oxymoron initially. History refers to the past, while the word digital is 
typically associated with the future. But the immersion of both of these seemingly seperate disciplines is really what 
first attracted me to this class. </p>
<p> Setting up took longer than I initially thought it would. But when I had managed to install the necessary applications and 
create accounts on Hypothesis.is, Github, Slack, and DH Box, I shifted my attention towards the readings. </p> 
<h2> Critical eye </h2>
<p> As a communications student, most of what I've learnt has been grounded in critical theory. These studies demanded 
approaching things a little differently, looking at almost everything with a critical eye. Before I understood this concept,
I tended to associate the word 'critical', with 'critique', with negativity and always with a predisposed cynical bias; but I 
have come to see that critical studies are actually more concerned with reflection and improvement. So I'm comforted to know 
that I'm familiar with the idea of a critical lens, so that I can apply it to the data we'll encounter. </p>
<p> I applied that critical lens when doing the reading annotations, however, I want to document some of the feedback I received
this week from so that I can return to this and reflect on it continually when annotating future readings. </p>

<i><p>Dr. Graham had a helpful guideline for the graduate digital humanities class I was in: annotate with an eye to what he calls
“the 3w’s of DH [Digital Humanities]:
what is <b>WEIRD</b> (e.g. unfamiliar to your experience or discipline), 
<b>WONDERFUL</b> (e.g. makes you see your research, your discipline, and so on, in an exciting way), 
or <b>WORRYING</b> (e.g. something that shakes your core assumption or something that seems problematic to you).” </p></i>
